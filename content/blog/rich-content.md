I am currently working on a project for the 2020 Fantasy Baseball season. I am building a website that will take information from an ESPN league and create a different breakdown in the league.
For example, there are only two different ways you can make your ESPN standings, but I want to have a user-customizable standings table based on what they want to be first, second, and third tiebreakers. 
Once the MLB season starts, I will be updating the website weekly.
